[![Continuous Deployment Workflow](https://github.com/TasneemHegazy/CloudPressHub-Deploy/actions/workflows/deployment.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/TasneemHegazy/CloudPressHub-Deploy/actions/workflows/deployment.yml)

_**Hey there! This repository represents a state-of-the-art implementation of CI/CD for a WordPress website, powered by the LEMP (Linux, Nginx, MySQL, PHP) stack, and streamlined by GitHub Actions. while following best practices for security, performance, and automation.**_

## Tech Stack üõ†Ô∏è

- **Web Server:** I'm using Nginx web server, carefully configured for optimum website performance. Below are some of the optimizations I've implemented:

   - **Caching:** I've added caching to make my website lightning-fast.

   - **Gzip Compression:** Data gets a shrink-wrap treatment for faster transmission.

- **Database:** MySQL/MariaDB ensures robust data management for my WordPress website, ensuring it runs smoothly.

- **Hosting:** I host my website on AWS EC2 instances, providing scalability and reliability.

- **SSL/TLS Encryption:** Secure communication between my server and clients is guaranteed through Let's Encrypt SSL/TLS certificates.

- **Domain Names:** I utilize free domain names from [noip.com](https://www.noip.com/) to give my website a professional online identity.

- **CI/CD Automation:** GitHub Actions is my CI/CD automation tool of choice, ensuring seamless and efficient deployment and making life easier.

## Features üåü

- **Enhanced Security:** I follow industry best practices to ensure the highest level of security for your WordPress website, like strong passwords and limited user access. 

- **Automated Deployment:** My GitHub Actions workflow handles the automated deployment of my WordPress website to my AWS EC2 instances.

- **Dependency Management:** I cache Composer dependencies to speed up future runs and run PHP Code Sniffer to maintain code quality. Any fixes suggested by PHP Code Sniffer are automatically committed.

- **Effortless Deployment:** The master branch is automatically deployed to my EC2 server using rsync, making continuous deployment a breeze.

- **Slack Integration:** Receive real-time updates on my project's status by sending messages to a designated Slack channel. I'll be instantly informed in case of job failures.

- **Contributor Engagement:** I also have a workflow in place to welcome new contributors when they open new issues or pull requests. Building a collaborative community is a priority.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- **Cloud Server**: You will need access to a Virtual Private Server (VPS) from a major cloud provider like AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, or DigitalOcean.

- **GitHub Account**: You need a GitHub account for version control and collaboration. If you don't have one, you can sign up for free at [GitHub](https://github.com/).

- **Site Domain**: You can register a domain of your choice or use a temporary domain/IP-based URL. Alternatively, you can use free domain names from [noip.com](https://www.noip.com/).

Now, let's dive into the setup and deployment process step by step.

## üõ†Ô∏è Server Provisioning

Let's start by getting my server up and running on AWS (or your cloud provider of choice). Here's the plan:

-   Provision an EC2 instance on AWS with a secure Linux distribution
    (e.g., Ubuntu 22.04).

-   Configure security groups to allow necessary incoming trafficand be a bit strict with unnecessary access.

-   Generate and configure SSH key pairs for secure remote access...

## üíª Nginx, MySQL/MariaDB, and PHP Setup

-   Install and configure Nginx as the web server.

   ```bash
   sudo apt update

   sudo apt install nginx

   sudo systemctl start nginx

   sudo systemctl enable nginx
   ```
-   Set up MySQL/MariaDB as the database and configure it securely.

   ```bash
   sudo apt install mysql-server

   sudo systemctl start mysql

   sudo systemctl enable mysql
      
   sudo mysql_secure_installation
   ```

   Follow the prompts to set a root password and secure your MySQL installation.

-   Install and configure PHP for processing dynamic content.

```bash
sudo yum install php php-mysqlnd php-fpm -y

sudo systemctl start php-fpm

sudo systemctl enable php-fpm
```
## üåê WordPress Website Configuration
-   Access your EC2 instance and set up a WordPress website.

-   Navigate to your Nginx web server root directory.

```bash
cd /var/www/html/
   ```

-   Download and Extract WordPress:
   
   ```bash
   sudo wget https://wordpress.org/latest.tar.gz
   sudo tar -xzvf latest.tar.gz
   ```

-   Set Permissions:
    
    ```bash
    sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html/wordpress
    sudo chmod -R 755 /var/www/html/wordpress
    ```

-   Create a MySQL Database and User:

    Access MySQL with root privileges:
    
    ```bash
    sudo mysql -u root -p
    ```

    Create a WordPress database, user, and grant privileges:
    
    ```sql
    CREATE DATABASE wordpress;
    CREATE USER 'wordpressuser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
    GRANT ALL ON wordpress.* TO 'wordpressuser'@'localhost';
    FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
    EXIT;
    ```

-   Configure WordPress:
    
    Rename the WordPress sample configuration file and edit it:

    ```bash
    cp /var/www/html/wordpress/wp-config-sample.php /var/www/html/wordpress/wp-config.php
    sudo nano /var/www/html/wordpress/wp-config.php
    ```

    Update the database details with the database name, username, and password you created earlier.

-   WordPress Website Setup:
    
    Open your web browser and access your server's domaster name or IP address. Follow the WordPress setup wizard to complete the installation.

-   Secure Your WordPress Installation: üîí
    
    After installation, follow best practices for WordPress security. This includes strong passwords, limiting user privileges, and keeping plugins and themes up to date.

-   Implement SSL/TLS certificate using Let\'s Encrypt for secure
    communication.

## **GitHub Repository Setup**

-   Create a GitHub repository for this project.

   On your server, navigate to your WordPress project directory:

    cd /var/www/html/wordpress

    # Initialize a Git repository

    git init

    # Add and Commit Files

    git add .
    git commit -m "Initial commit"

-   Link to Your GitHub Repository:
    
    Go back to GitHub, and you'll find a URL for your repository. Link your local repository to GitHub by following the instructions on the GitHub website.


```bash

git remote add origin  your-github-repo-url.git

git branch -M master

git push -u origin master
```

-   files pushed from the ec2 instances to the git repository

- Your WordPress site should now be running on your server, and your code is version-controlled in your GitHub repository. You can push updates to GitHub whenever you make changes to your site.
