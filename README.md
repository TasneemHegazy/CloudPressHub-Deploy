## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- **Cloud Server**: You will need access to a Virtual Private Server (VPS) from a major cloud provider like AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, or DigitalOcean.

- **GitHub Account**: You need a GitHub account for version control and collaboration. If you don't have one, you can sign up for free at [GitHub](https://github.com/).

- **Site Domain**: You can register a domain of your choice or use a temporary domain/IP-based URL. Alternatively, you can use free domain names from [noip.com](https://www.noip.com/).

Now, let's dive into the setup and deployment process step by step.

## üõ†Ô∏è Server Provisioning

Let's start by getting my server up and running on AWS (or your cloud provider of choice). Here's the plan:

-   Provision an EC2 instance on AWS with a secure Linux distribution
    (e.g., Ubuntu 22.04).

-   Configure security groups to allow necessary incoming trafficand be a bit strict with unnecessary access.

-   Generate and configure SSH key pairs for secure remote access...

## üíª Nginx, MySQL/MariaDB, and PHP Setup

-   Install and configure Nginx as the web server.

   ```bash
   sudo apt update

   sudo apt install nginx

   sudo systemctl start nginx

   sudo systemctl enable nginx
   ```
-   Set up MySQL/MariaDB as the database and configure it securely.

   ```bash
   sudo apt install mysql-server

   sudo systemctl start mysql

   sudo systemctl enable mysql
      
   sudo mysql_secure_installation
   ```

   Follow the prompts to set a root password and secure your MySQL installation.

-   Install and configure PHP for processing dynamic content.

```bash
sudo yum install php php-mysqlnd php-fpm -y

sudo systemctl start php-fpm

sudo systemctl enable php-fpm
```
## üåê WordPress Website Configuration
-   Access your EC2 instance and set up a WordPress website.

-   Navigate to your Nginx web server root directory.

```bash
cd /var/www/html/
   ```

-   Download and Extract WordPress:
   
   ```bash
   sudo wget https://wordpress.org/latest.tar.gz
   sudo tar -xzvf latest.tar.gz
   ```

-   Set Permissions:
    
    ```bash
    sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html/wordpress
    sudo chmod -R 755 /var/www/html/wordpress
    ```

-   Create a MySQL Database and User:

    Access MySQL with root privileges:
    
    ```bash
    sudo mysql -u root -p
    ```

    Create a WordPress database, user, and grant privileges:
    
    ```sql
    CREATE DATABASE wordpress;
    CREATE USER 'wordpressuser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
    GRANT ALL ON wordpress.* TO 'wordpressuser'@'localhost';
    FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
    EXIT;
    ```

-   Configure WordPress:
    
    Rename the WordPress sample configuration file and edit it:

    ```bash
    cp /var/www/html/wordpress/wp-config-sample.php /var/www/html/wordpress/wp-config.php
    sudo nano /var/www/html/wordpress/wp-config.php
    ```

    Update the database details with the database name, username, and password you created earlier.

-   WordPress Website Setup:
    
    Open your web browser and access your server's domaster name or IP address. Follow the WordPress setup wizard to complete the installation.

-   Secure Your WordPress Installation: üîí
    
    After installation, follow best practices for WordPress security. This includes strong passwords, limiting user privileges, and keeping plugins and themes up to date.

-   Implement SSL/TLS certificate using Let\'s Encrypt for secure
    communication.

## **GitHub Repository Setup**

-   Create a GitHub repository for this project.

   On your server, navigate to your WordPress project directory:

    cd /var/www/html/wordpress

    # Initialize a Git repository

    git init

    # Add and Commit Files

    git add .
    git commit -m "Initial commit"

-   Link to Your GitHub Repository:
    
    Go back to GitHub, and you'll find a URL for your repository. Link your local repository to GitHub by following the instructions on the GitHub website.


```bash

git remote add origin  your-github-repo-url.git

git branch -M master

git push -u origin master
```

-   files pushed from the ec2 instances to the git repository

- Your WordPress site should now be running on your server, and your code is version-controlled in your GitHub repository. You can push updates to GitHub whenever you make changes to your site.

## üõ†Ô∏è GitHub Actions Workflow

This workflow is designed to be super-easy to integrate into your own WordPress project or any other PHP-based project. It's designed to ensure code quality and deploy changes to both staging and production environments from the master branch.

## Workflow Overview

1. **PHP Coding Standards Check (PHPCS)**
   - Runs PHP Code Sniffer to enforce coding standards.
   - Utilizes a MySQL service for database-related checks.
   - Caches Composer dependencies for faster subsequent runs.

2. **Deploy to Staging**
   - Deploys the application to the staging environment.
   - Uses rsync to transfer files securely to the staging server.

3. **Deploy to Production (Manual)**
   - **Note:** Production deployment is configured for manual approval.
   - To deploy to production, follow these steps:
     - Review the changes in the production environment.
     - Approve the deployment.
     - Manually trigger the production deployment workflow.

4. **Slack Notification**
   - Sends a notification to a Slack channel upon successful deployment to staging or production.

## How to Use
